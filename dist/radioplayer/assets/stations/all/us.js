Playing today's greatest rock songs, yesterday's monster tracks, deeper album cuts as well as tunes by lesser known artists. Savage Radio is committed to bringing you the finest rock radio experience over the internet. Not knowing what you are going to hear next, as well as anticipating favorite songs and new tracks being played,  has always been part of the magic of listening to the radio. It's a formula that you just don't get with your personal playlist or on your current radio dial. Savage Radio keeps it interesting and should not disappoint. If you remember the great days of terrestrial rock radio then what you will find is that excitement lives here.

That’s where we come in as you know by now we are a variety station so that being said we always like to try and provide the listeners with better variety and better music that the big guys have failed to provide. So If your a indie band we always like to hear from you with that being said we also like to provide listeners with great content from our shows"
